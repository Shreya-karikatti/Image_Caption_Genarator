**ABSTRACT**
Image caption generation for tourist spots involves the development of a model that can automatically generate descriptive and informative captions for images depicting various tourist attractions, landmarks, or scenic views. 
Problem Statement: Given a dataset of images showcasing different tourist spots, the task is to develop a deep learning model that can generate accurate and contextually relevant captions describing the contents of these images.
Input: 
Dataset of tourist spot images (e.g., images of landmarks, natural landscapes, historical sites).
Ground truth captions corresponding to each image, providing accurate descriptions of the depicted scene.
Output:
Automatically generated captions for each input image, describing the contents of the image in a descriptive and informative manner.
